# FEMA-claim-severity-model
This repository contains an ongoing analysis of FEMA hurricane claims data, focusing on claim severity modeling using R. The project aims to explore historical hurricane-related insurance claims, identify key risk factors, and develop predictive models for claim severity.
Link to public data: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v2
Current Progress:

âœ… Data cleaning and preprocessing
âœ… Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
âœ… Initial feature engineering
ðŸ”„ Handling missing data using Multiple Imputation (MI), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Monte Carlo Likelihood Estimation (MCLE)
ðŸ”„ Building and evaluating claim severity models
Next Steps:

    Fine-tune predictive model using GLM
    Validate and interpret model results
    Visualize findings with R-based dashboards

ðŸš§ Note: This project is a work in progress, and updates will be added as analysis progresses. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

# FEMA-claim-severity-model
This repository contains an ongoing analysis of FEMA hurricane claims data, focusing on claim severity modeling using R. The project aims to explore historical hurricane-related insurance claims, identify key risk factors, and develop predictive models for claim severity.

Link to public data: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v2

Current Progress:

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing

✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

✅ Initial feature engineering

✅ Handling missing data, adding additional features, managing data types, and examing outliers

✅ Building and evaluating claim severity models

Next Steps:

    Fine-tune predictive model using GLM
    Validate and interpret model results
    Visualize findings with R-based dashboards

🚧 Note: This project is a work in progress, and updates will be added as analysis progresses. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
